# SQL Practice Repository

Welcome to my SQL practice repository! This repository is designed to showcase my basic SQL skills and contains various SQL scripts and queries that I have used for learning and practice.

## Database Setup

The central database can be generated from the `create-databases.sql` file. This script is used to generate the raw data and set up the tables that I practice with. To create the database, run the following command in your SQL environment:

```sql
source create-databases.sql;
```

# Folder Structure
Inside the repository, there is an Output folder which contains several subfolders. Each subfolder showcases fundamental SQL functions that I have been practicing. Below is a brief overview of each folder:

## AND OR SELECT WHERE
This folder contains SQL queries that demonstrate the use of the AND, OR, SELECT and WHERE clauses. These queries are fundamental for filtering data and selecting specific columns from a table.

## IN BETWEEN
This folder includes SQL queries that use the IN and BETWEEN operators. These operators are used to filter data based on a range of values or a list of specific values.

## LIKE REGEXP NULL
In this folder, you'll find SQL queries that make use of the LIKE and REGEXP operators for pattern matching, as well as handling NULL and NOT NULL values in SQL.

## OUTER INNER JOINS
This folder contains SQL queries that demonstrate the use of OUTER and INNER joins. Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

## ORDER LIMIT
Here, you will find SQL queries that use the ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses. These clauses are used to sort the result set and limit the number of rows returned, respectively.

## UNION INSERTING UPDATING
This folder includes SQL queries that demonstrate the use of the UNION operator to combine result sets, as well as INSERT and UPDATE statements for modifying data in the tables.

## USING NATURAL
In this folder, you will find SQL queries that use the NATURAL JOIN clause. Natural joins are used to join tables based on columns with the same name and datatype in both tables.

# Getting Started
To get started with the SQL scripts in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the desired folder to explore the SQL queries.

```
git clone https://github.com/TalhaHayat/sql-basic.git
cd sql-practice/Output
```

You can run the SQL scripts in your preferred SQL environment to see the results and further understand the concepts.
